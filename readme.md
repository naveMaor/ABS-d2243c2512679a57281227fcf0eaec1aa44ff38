# p2p “social lending” system

Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending enables individuals to obtain loans directly from other individuals, cutting out the financial institution as the middleman.
Websites that facilitate P2P lending have greatly increased its adoption as an alternative method of financing.

P2P lending is also known as “social lending” or “crowd lending.”

The project is a desktop application, based on a social loan system that brings together borrowers and investors.
The investors' funds are spread amongst many loans for optimal risk diversification and in accordance with the investor's preferences.
The system calculates appropriate fund amounts and interest rates and also knows when a client is potentially at risk.
The system was built on the client side using JavaFX and on the server side in okhttp.
